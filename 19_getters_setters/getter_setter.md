## `User` Class ‚Äî Getters and Setters in JavaScript

This example demonstrates how to use **getters** and **setters** in a JavaScript class to safely handle a `password` property.

---

### üìù Code

```js
class User{
    constructor(email,password) {
        this.email = email 
        this.password = password
    }   
    get password(){
        // return "!***123*$#@"
        return this._password.toUpperCase()
    }
    set password(value){
        this._password = value
        console.log("hello there password updation")
    }
}

const dhruv = new User("dhruv@gmail.com","abc")
console.log(dhruv.password) //ABC

dhruv.password = "hello"
console.log(dhruv.password)
```

---

### ‚ö° Explanation

* The `constructor` sets `email` and `password` for a user.
* The `set password(value)` method is called whenever you assign to `dhruv.password`.
* The `get password()` method is called whenever you read `dhruv.password`.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Direct Access Without Getter/Setter

```js
// Anyone can directly access or change the password:
dhruv.password = "hacked"
console.log(dhruv.password) //hacked
// There's no validation, no protection, no control over how the password is used or stored.
// Getter hides the actual password and can return something safe (like ********).

// Setter validates new values before allowing assignment. 
```

Here, the password is stored and shown as plain text, which is unsafe.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistake ‚Äî Infinite Recursion

```js
set password(value){
        this.password = value 
        console.log("hello there password updation")
    }

// Maximum call stack size exceeded
        
// in this setter is called again and agin because constructir and setter both tryu to set value
```

**Why this fails:**

* `this.password = value` inside the `set password` again calls the same setter.
* This creates an **infinite loop** ‚Üí `Maximum call stack size exceeded`.

---

### ‚úÖ Fix ‚Äî Using `_password`

```js
// the maximum call stack error is becaus eof setter 
// because of this we use a new variable decalration "_password" for that so there is no confusion between the constructor and setter 
// sfter using "_password"  the error is of getter because it does not matches 

// now as  the password declaration is happending in the getters and setters so in get passowrd() we also have to use "_password"
```

* By storing the real value in a **different property (`_password`)**, the setter no longer calls itself again.
* The getter then reads from `_password`.

---

### ‚úÖ Final Behavior

* Setting password:

  ```js
  dhruv.password = "hello";
  // logs: hello there password updation
  ```

* Getting password:

  ```js
  console.log(dhruv.password); 
  // returns: HELLO
  ```

---

This pattern keeps your password **encapsulated** and **prevents accidental infinite recursion.**

If you want, I can also add a small **diagram showing the flow between constructor ‚Üí setter ‚Üí getter ‚Üí property** inside the same `.md`.
Would you like me to add that too?
